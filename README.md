# Constructor-Word-Guess
A node command-line version of hangman, featuring colored text and ASCII art.

After cloning the repository to your machine, download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/ if you don't already have it on your machine. Once that's taken care of, navigate to the directory containing all the hangman files and type in `npm install` in order install all the appropriate modules. If everything was installed correctly, you should be able to type in `node index.js` and play the game.

Hopefully the in-game prompts making playing the game intuitive. Enjoy!
